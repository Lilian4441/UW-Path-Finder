# UW-Path-Finder
<h3>A UW campus navigation app utilizing graph data structures.</h3>
<h4>Completed: December 2023</h4>

This project involved implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for a UW campus navigation app, handling graph data structures, and DOT file processing. It included developing interfaces for pathfinding, featuring path retrieval, walking times, and dataset statistics.
**Note: the included files are of the backend only, and do not function fully. This was a partner project, and my partner was responsible for the frontend.**
